                    <h2>The Risk Framework That Prevented a £2M Loss</h2>
                    
                    <p>Most risk assessment is theatre. Pretty matrices, detailed registers, regular reviews—all designed to show "risk management" is happening while the real risks go unidentified until they cause major problems.</p>
                    
                    <p>A software company was planning their largest product launch ever. Standard risk assessment identified the usual suspects: technical delays, budget overruns, competitive responses.</p>
                    
                    <p>But their Reality Check risk framework surfaced a different concern: "What if our primary database can't handle 10x traffic?" This seemed unlikely—their system had handled growth fine so far.</p>
                    
                    <p>They spent £50k stress-testing their infrastructure. Good thing: at 7x their current load, response times became unusable. They redesigned the architecture before launch instead of after disaster.</p>
                    
                    <p>Launch went smoothly. Post-mortem revealed that traditional risk assessment would have missed this issue because it wasn't "predictable" based on past experience.</p>

                    <h2>Framework 1: Pre-Mortem Risk Analysis</h2>

                    <h3>The Process:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Set the scene:</strong> "It's 12 months from now. This initiative has failed spectacularly."</li>
                        <li><strong>Generate failure stories:</strong> Each team member writes what went wrong</li>
                        <li><strong>Categorize failures:</strong> Group similar failure modes</li>
                        <li><strong>Assess likelihood:</strong> Which failure stories seem most plausible?</li>
                        <li><strong>Build defenses:</strong> What would prevent each failure mode?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Why This Works Better:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Psychological safety:</strong> It's easier to voice concerns when failure is assumed</li>
                        <li><strong>Specific scenarios:</strong> Forces concrete thinking rather than abstract risk categories</li>
                        <li><strong>Team knowledge:</strong> Surfaces concerns that individuals might not voice otherwise</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Real Example:</h3>
                    <p>Marketing team planning major campaign launch.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Traditional risk assessment identified:</strong> Budget overruns, creative delays, media placement issues</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Pre-mortem revealed:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Campaign launched but our website crashed from traffic we couldn't handle"</li>
                        <li>"Great response to campaign but our sales team wasn't trained on new messaging"</li>
                        <li>"Campaign succeeded but fulfilled orders wrong because we didn't update logistics procedures"</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> They addressed infrastructure, training, and operational issues that weren't on traditional risk registers.</p>

                    <h2>Framework 2: The "What Could Kill Us?" Analysis</h2>
                    
                    <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Identify existential or business-critical risks, not just project risks.</p>

                    <h3>The Questions:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Revenue concentration:</strong> What if our biggest client left?</li>
                        <li><strong>Key person dependency:</strong> What if critical people were unavailable?</li>
                        <li><strong>Single point of failure:</strong> What systems/processes have no backup?</li>
                        <li><strong>Market shifts:</strong> What if customer needs changed dramatically?</li>
                        <li><strong>Competitive threats:</strong> What if a competitor made our offering obsolete?</li>
                        <li><strong>Regulatory changes:</strong> What if compliance requirements changed?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Implementation:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Monthly leadership review:</strong> 30 minutes focused only on existential risks</li>
                        <li><strong>Quarterly deep dive:</strong> Full analysis with scenarios and mitigation plans</li>
                        <li><strong>Annual external review:</strong> Outside perspective on blind spots</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Case Study:</h3>
                    <p>Consultancy discovered 67% of revenue came from three clients. Traditional risk management hadn't flagged this because each client relationship was "stable."</p>
                    
                    <p>"What could kill us?" analysis revealed this concentration risk. They diversified their client base over 18 months. Good timing: one of their major clients got acquired and immediately cancelled all external consulting contracts.</p>

                    <h2>Framework 3: Dynamic Risk Monitoring</h2>
                    
                    <p><strong>Problem with traditional approaches:</strong> Risk assessments become outdated quickly but are reviewed infrequently.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Build risk indicators that update automatically.</p>

                    <h3>Leading Risk Indicators:</h3>
                    
                    <p><strong>For project risks:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Budget burn rate vs. milestone completion</li>
                        <li>Team overtime hours (indicator of scope creep)</li>
                        <li>Stakeholder meeting attendance (indicator of engagement)</li>
                        <li>Code quality metrics (indicator of technical debt)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>For business risks:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Customer concentration ratios</li>
                        <li>Employee retention by department</li>
                        <li>Cash runway at current burn rate</li>
                        <li>Customer acquisition cost trends</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Implementation:</h3>
                    <p>Create dashboards that track these indicators monthly. Set thresholds that trigger risk reviews.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If top 5 clients represent >60% of revenue, trigger client diversification planning. If employee retention in critical departments drops below 85%, trigger retention analysis.</p>

                    <h2>Framework 4: Stress Testing Assumptions</h2>
                    
                    <p><strong>Recognize that most risks come from wrong assumptions, not unexpected events.</strong></p>

                    <h3>The Process:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>List critical assumptions:</strong> What must be true for success?</li>
                        <li><strong>Identify assumption dependencies:</strong> Which assumptions depend on others?</li>
                        <li><strong>Test assumption robustness:</strong> What if each assumption is 50% wrong?</li>
                        <li><strong>Plan assumption monitoring:</strong> How will you know if assumptions become invalid?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Business Application:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Strategic planning assumptions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Market size will grow 15% annually</li>
                        <li>Competitors won't respond aggressively</li>
                        <li>Our team can execute this new capability</li>
                        <li>Regulatory environment will remain stable</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Stress test:</strong> What if market grows 5% instead of 15%? What if main competitor cuts prices 30%? What if key team members leave during implementation?</p>

                    <h3>Real Example:</h3>
                    <p>E-commerce company assumed 20% annual customer growth. Stress testing revealed that if growth was only 10%, their entire business model needed revision (high fixed costs, long payback periods).</p>
                    
                    <p>They redesigned their cost structure to be profitable at 10% growth. When actual growth turned out to be 12%, they were still successful instead of in crisis.</p>

                    <h2>Framework 5: Cascading Risk Analysis</h2>
                    
                    <p><strong>Recognize that risks don't happen in isolation—they trigger other risks.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Mapping Process:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Primary risk identification:</strong> What could initially go wrong?</li>
                        <li><strong>Secondary impact analysis:</strong> What would each primary risk trigger?</li>
                        <li><strong>Tertiary effect assessment:</strong> What would secondary impacts cause?</li>
                        <li><strong>System vulnerability points:</strong> Where do risk cascades become uncontrollable?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Example: Product Launch Risk Cascade</h3>
                    
                    <p><strong>Primary risk:</strong> Technical delays push launch back 2 months</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Secondary impacts:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Marketing campaign money wasted</li>
                        <li>Sales team loses momentum</li>
                        <li>Competitor gets market advantage</li>
                        <li>Team morale suffers</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Tertiary effects:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Revenue targets missed for quarter</li>
                        <li>Investor confidence drops</li>
                        <li>Key team members start looking elsewhere</li>
                        <li>Next product development delayed</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Critical insight:</strong> The real risk isn't technical delays—it's losing market position and team confidence.</p>

                    <h2>Implementation: Building Risk Reality Checks</h2>

                    <h3>Monthly Risk Reality Check (30 minutes):</h3>
                    
                    <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> "What evidence do we have that our top risks are under control?"</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Not "status green" but actual evidence of risk mitigation</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> "What surprised us about risk this month?"</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>New risks that emerged</li>
                        <li>Existing risks that behaved unexpectedly</li>
                        <li>Risk mitigation that didn't work as expected</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> "What risks are we pretending not to know about?"</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Risks people privately worry about but haven't voiced</li>
                        <li>Risks that are "someone else's problem"</li>
                        <li>Risks that are uncomfortable to acknowledge</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Risk Warning Signs</h2>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Risk assessments haven't changed in months</li>
                        <li>Most risks are rated "medium" or "low"</li>
                        <li>Risk reviews focus on process compliance, not actual risks</li>
                        <li>People say "that's not my risk" frequently</li>
                        <li>Risk mitigation plans are vague or lack specific owners</li>
                        <li>No risks have actually materialized (suggesting you're missing real risks)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                    
                    <p>Risk management isn't about predicting every possible problem—it's about building organizational capability to identify, assess, and respond to risks quickly.</p>
                    
                    <p>The best risk frameworks focus on:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Surfacing hidden risks</strong> through structured imagination</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitoring risk indicators</strong> that update continuously</li>
                        <li><strong>Testing critical assumptions</strong> regularly</li>
                        <li><strong>Understanding risk cascades</strong> and system vulnerabilities</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p><strong>Remember:</strong> The biggest risks are often the ones you haven't identified yet.</p>
